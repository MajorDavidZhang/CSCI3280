Please note that this week’s lectures (Wednesday, Feb 11 and Thursday, Feb 12) are canceled due to the professor having a sudden medical emergency.

However, the Tutorial session will proceed as scheduled. Since we will be covering the Convolution Operation—which is critical for Assignment 2—your attendance is highly recommended.

Date: Wednesday, Feb 11

Time: 10:30 - 11:15

Location: Y.C. Liang Hall 104

Updated arrangements for the missed lectures will be announced once confirmed. Please stay tuned for further information.

Thank you for your understanding.
